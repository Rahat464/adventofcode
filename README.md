# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge, a series of 25 programming puzzles that are released daily from December 1st to December 25th.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an online event created by Eric Wastl. It consists of a variety of small programming problems that can be solved in any programming language. The problems are designed to be fun and engaging, and to test your problem-solving skills and creativity. Some of the problems are related to a story or a theme, while others are more abstract or mathematical. The difficulty of the problems varies, but they are generally accessible to anyone who enjoys coding.

Please note that these solutions are not intended to be the best or the most optimal ones. They are simply my personal attempts at solving the puzzles, and they may contain errors or inefficiencies. I encourage you to try to solve the problems on your own before looking at my solutions, and to compare your solutions with others on the [Advent of Code subreddit] or the [Advent of Code Discord server]. You may also find helpful resources and tips on the [Advent of Code website].
